## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months earlier.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly 
discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## Divorce study felled by a coding error gets a second chance

- **Original conclusion:** The risk of divorce in a heterosexual marriage increases when the wife falls ill, but not the husband. 

- **Corrected conclusion:** Based on the corrected analysis, we conclude that there are not gender differences in the relationship between gender, pooled illness onset, and divorce.

## Divorce study retraction: Editor's note

- "The research environment is fast-paced given the ethos to “publish or perish"."

- "[...] research is becoming increasingly complex, with greater calls for transdisciplinary collaborations, “big data,” and more sophisticated research questions and methods [...] data sets often have multiple files that require merging, change the wording of questions over time, provide incomplete codebooks, and have unclear and sometimes duplicative variables."

- "Given these issues, I would not be surprised if coding errors were fairly common [...]"

# Reproducibility: why should you care?

---

## Think back to every time...

- The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
- In what order do I run these scripts?
- Where did we get this data file?
- Why did I omit those samples?
- How did I make that figure?
- "Your script is now giving an error."
- "The attached is similar to the code we used."

## No collaborators?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&gt;Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, &lt;br&gt;
but you don’t reply to emails.

## Two pronged approach

\#1 
Convince researchers to adopt a reproducible research workflow

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

\#2
Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow

# Reproducibility: how?

---

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns 

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

---

## Roadmap

1. Scriptability `\(\rightarrow\)` R

2. Literate programming `\(\rightarrow\)` R Markdown

3. Version control `\(\rightarrow\)` Git / GitHub

# Literate Programming

---

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- And tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- But they have never been as accessible as the current tools: R Markdown

---

## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Simple syntax means easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Allows for easy web authoring.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.

---

## What is R Markdown?

Well, it's R + Markdown:

- Ease of Markdown syntax

- Rendering of R code to produce output and plots

- Ability to include LaTeX: `\(\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x\)`

## It's your lucky day!

You got some data.

- `WorldCupMatches-01.csv`: Match info for each game in pre-2000 World Cups
- Codebook at https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/teach-data-sci-icots2018/blob/master/01-04-rmarkdown/data/README.md
- Ultimate goal: Visualize the total number of goals for each World Cup over time.

.instructions[
Go to the project called **World Cup Goals** on RStudio Cloud and open  `world-cup-goals.Rmd`. Knit the document. Then, update the **yaml** with your information, and knit again.
]

---

## The YAML

YAML: Yet another Markdown language

- Fields like `title`, `subtitle`, `author`, `date`
- You can also change `output` formats: `html_document` for web authoring, 
`github_document` for markdown document easily viewable on GitHub, 
`pdf_document` for PDF (requires TeX), `word_document` for MS Word 
(requires Word)
- Can use inline R code in values (see `date`)

---

## Chunk options

- Turn off messages with `message = FALSE`
- Turn off warnings with `warning = FALSE`
- Hide code with `echo = FALSE`
- Exclude chunk from doc with `include = FALSE` to prevent code and results from 
appearing in the finished file. Code in the chunk will still be ran, and the 
results can be used by other chunks.
- Display error messages in document with `error = TRUE`, as opposed to stopping 
render when errors occur `error = FALSE`, which is the default
- Set these per chunk or globally in a `setup` chunk on top of the document 
with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(...)`

&lt;img src="img/chunk-opts.png" alt="markdown" style="width:900px"&gt;

---

## Not so lucky after all

.instructions[
Turns out there is an error in the data you received: The number of `home_team_goals` in 1998 by Brazil (in the game vs. Denmark played on 03 Jul 1998) should be 3, not 0. Implement a fix and redo the analysis.
]

---

## More data!

.instructions[
And now you received more data: World Cup matches post-2000. The data are in
`data/WorldCupMatches-02.csv`. Redo the analysis combining data from both files.
]

---

## Tips

- Make sure RStudio and the `rmarkdown` package (and its dependencies) are 
up-to-date.

--

- Set a global option for `error = TRUE` (or for a given chunk) so that your 
document renders even when there are errors.

--

- Don’t try to change working directory within an R Markdown document. (If you 
do still decide to use setwd in a code chunk, beware that the new working 
directory will only apply to that specific code chunk, and any following code 
chunks will revert back to use the original working directory.)
