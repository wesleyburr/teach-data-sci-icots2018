Notes from workshop with Mine & Colin

Getting Started & Computing
----------------------------
* rstudio.cloud - free for academic (teaching) use moving forward
* memory issues (tomorrow)

* using a Rmd interactive document on the first day - one small change = "coding"
* versus a notebook?
* introducing the concept on the first day is better than using a Shiny interface and hiding the guts
    - motivation for what will be possible
    - need to build the course backwards, from the "outcomes" at the end, to what we start with on Day 1

Reproducibility
----------------
* scriptability - some good notes on how to make it clear
* literature programming (Donald Knuth)
*
